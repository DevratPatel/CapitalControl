CapitalControl : Bank Management System

  CapitalControl Bank Management System will be a simple banking system that will
allow a user to create an account from which they can deposit and withdraw money using
commands. The system will also allow them to inquire about their balance, calculate interest, and
delete their account if they so wish. The system will also hold information for multiple accounts,
so multiple users can use it without losing data.
